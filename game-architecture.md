### Domino Sudoku Game Idea

#### Concept
**Domino Sudoku**: Combine the placement strategy of Dominoes with the logic of Sudoku.

#### How It Works
1. **Grid Setup**: The game is played on a 9x12 grid, divided into 3x4 subgrids.
2. **Domino Pieces**: Each domino piece has two numbers (like traditional dominoes). These numbers range from 1 to 12.
3. **Placement Rules**: Players place domino pieces on the grid, ensuring that each number follows Sudoku rules (each row, column, and 3x4 subgrid must contain unique numbers).
4. **Puzzle Solving**: The challenge is to place all domino pieces correctly while adhering to Sudoku constraints. Players must think ahead to ensure that each placement doesn't violate the Sudoku rules.

#### Example
- A domino piece with numbers 3 and 5 can be placed horizontally (1x2) or vertically (2x1) on the grid.
- If placed horizontally in the first row, the numbers 3 and 5 must not repeat in the same row, column, or 3x4 subgrid.

#### Objective
- Complete the grid by placing all domino pieces correctly, ensuring that the Sudoku rules are followed.

### High-Level Architecture

#### Components
1. **Game Engine**: Handles the logic for placing domino pieces and checking Sudoku constraints.
2. **User Interface**: Provides an interactive grid for players to place domino pieces.
3. **Puzzle Generator**: Creates new puzzles by generating valid domino placements that adhere to Sudoku rules.
4. **Scoring System**: Tracks player progress and scores based on puzzle completion and accuracy.

#### Tech Stack
1. **Frontend**:
   - **React**: For building the interactive user interface.
   - **Redux**: For managing game state.
   - **CSS/SCSS**: For styling the game interface.

2. **Backend**:
   - **Node.js**: For server-side logic and API endpoints.
   - **Express**: For handling HTTP requests and routing.
   - **MongoDB**: For storing user data, scores, and puzzle configurations.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - **JavaScript**: For implementing the game engine and puzzle generator.
   - **WebSocket**: For real-time updates and multiplayer functionality.

4. **Deployment**:
   - **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
   - **Azure container apps**: For hosting and scaling the application.
