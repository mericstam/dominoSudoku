# Domino Sudoku Game Architecture

## Game Concept
**Domino Sudoku**: A unique puzzle game that combines the placement strategy of Dominoes with the logical constraints of Sudoku puzzles.

## Game Mechanics

### Grid Structure
- **Board Size**: 9x12 grid, divided into 3x4 subgrids
- **Cell Content**: Numbers from 1 to 12
- **Piece Structure**: Domino pieces, each containing two numbers

### Gameplay Rules
1. **Domino Placement**:
   - Each domino covers exactly two adjacent cells
   - Dominoes can be placed horizontally or vertically
   - All dominoes must be placed to complete the puzzle

2. **Sudoku Constraints**:
   - Each row must contain the numbers 1-12 exactly once
   - Each column must contain the numbers 1-12 exactly once
   - Each 3x4 subgrid must contain the numbers 1-12 exactly once

3. **Difficulty Levels**:
   - Easy: More pre-placed dominoes providing stronger hints
   - Medium: Balanced number of pre-placed dominoes
   - Hard: Minimal pre-placed dominoes for maximum challenge

## System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Game Engine**:
   - Enforces game rules and validates moves
   - Tracks domino placement and grid state
   - Provides validation for Sudoku constraints

2. **User Interface**:
   - Interactive grid for domino placement
   - Visual cues for valid/invalid moves
   - Controls for domino orientation and game options

3. **Puzzle Generator**:
   - Creates valid puzzle configurations
   - Ensures unique solutions for puzzles
   - Implements different difficulty levels

4. **Scoring System**:
   - Tracks completion time
   - Records solving accuracy
   - Provides performance metrics

### Technical Architecture

#### Frontend
- **React**: Component-based UI architecture
- **Redux**: State management for game data
- **CSS/SCSS**: Responsive styling with grid layouts for game board

#### Backend
- **Node.js**: Server runtime environment
- **Express**: API framework for game services
- **MongoDB**: Data persistence (optional for user progress/scores)

#### Game Logic
- **JavaScript**: Core game mechanics implementation
- **WebSocket**: Real-time updates (for potential multiplayer feature)

#### Deployment
- **Docker**: Container-based deployment
- **Azure container apps**: Cloud hosting platform
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment

## Implementation Details

### Puzzle Generation Algorithm
1. Generate a valid Sudoku solution for the 9x12 grid
2. Convert the solution into valid domino placements
3. Remove dominoes strategically based on difficulty level
4. Verify the puzzle has a unique solution

### Game State Management
- Track placed dominoes
- Maintain the current game board state
- Validate moves against Sudoku constraints
- Provide hint system based on current board state

### User Interaction Flow
1. Player selects difficulty level
2. Game presents the starting board with pre-placed dominoes
3. Player places dominoes according to rules
4. System validates each placement
5. Game concludes when all dominoes are correctly placed
